# 🚀 DevOps Project – CI/CD with Jenkins, Docker & AWS

This project demonstrates a **complete CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS EC2.  
The README is structured with **headlines, images, and code blocks** for clear documentation.

## 🏗 Architecture

**Workflow:**
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub  
2. Jenkins pulls the repo and builds Docker image  
3. Image pushed to AWS ECR  
4. Container deployed on EC2 instance  

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- AWS account with IAM user  
- Docker installed on local machine  
- Jenkins server (can be on EC2)  
- GitHub repo access  

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devops-project.git
cd devops-project
2️⃣ Build Docker Image
bash
Copy code
docker build -t myapp:latest .
3️⃣ Run Container
bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest
🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

Pipeline Stages:

Build: Jenkins builds Docker image

Test: Run unit tests

Push: Upload image to AWS ECR

Deploy: Run container on EC2

🧪 Validation
Test the running container:

bash
Copy code
curl http://<EC2-Public-IP>:8080
Expected output:

json
Copy code
{ "status": "ok" }
🧹 Cleanup
Stop containers and remove unused images:

bash
Copy code
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
docker system prune -af

### 📌 Steps for You to Try
1. Create a repo on GitHub (example: `devops-project`).  
2. Inside the repo, create a folder called `images/`.  
   - Put any `.png` file in it and rename it `architecture.png`.  
   - Another file as `pipeline.png`.  
   (Even a dummy screenshot will work for testing).  
3. Add the above `README.md` to your repo root.  
4. Push → check GitHub → you’ll see **headlines, code blocks, and images**.

👉 Do you want me to **make sample images (like architecture.png & pipeline.png)** for you right now, so you don’t need to draw them yourself?
